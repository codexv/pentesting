In this method we will be using both crunch and aircrack-ng inside Kali Linux to brute-force WPA2 passwords. But before we proceed let me quickly introduce you to our tools:

crunch - is a wordlist generator from a character set.

aircrack-ng - a 802.11 WEP / WPA-PSK key cracker.

I assume you already have aircrack-ng installed on your system and you already have a captured handshake ready for offline cracking. If not, I will post another article soon on how to use aircrack-ng to capture WPA2 handshakes.


For now let's get started and open a terminal!

If you don't have crunch yet you can install it by typing:
```
sudo apt-get install crunch
```

It usually takes crunch a long time to create a wordlist and consumes a lot of disk space too if you choose to save the ​‌​​​​​‌⁠​‌‌‌​‌​‌⁠​‌‌‌​‌​​⁠​‌‌​‌​​​⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌‌⁠​‌‌‌​​‌​⁠​​‌‌‌​‌​⁠​​‌​​​​​⁠​‌​​​​​‌⁠​‌‌​​​‌‌⁠​‌‌‌​​‌​⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌‌⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌​⁠​‌‌​‌​​‌⁠​‌‌‌‌​​​⁠​​‌​​​​​⁠​‌‌​​​‌‌⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌‌⁠​‌‌​​‌​​⁠​‌‌​​‌​‌⁠​‌‌‌​​‌​⁠​‌‌‌​​‌‌⁠​​‌​‌‌‌​⁠​‌‌‌​​​​⁠​‌‌​‌​​​⁠wordlist to your hard drive. Therefore, this technique can only be useful if somehow you already have an idea of what the password pattern is. The default wifi passwords of modem/routers provided by ISP's for example can be a target.

Let's say that after your research you figured out that the default wifi password is an 8 digit number that always starts ​‌​​​​​‌⁠​‌‌‌​‌​‌⁠​‌‌‌​‌​​⁠​‌‌​‌​​​⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌‌⁠​‌‌‌​​‌​⁠​​‌‌‌​‌​⁠​​‌​​​​​⁠​‌​​​​​‌⁠​‌‌​​​‌‌⁠​‌‌‌​​‌​⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌‌⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌​⁠​‌‌​‌​​‌⁠​‌‌‌‌​​​⁠​​‌​​​​​⁠​‌‌​​​‌‌⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌‌⁠​‌‌​​‌​​⁠​‌‌​​‌​‌⁠​‌‌‌​​‌​⁠​‌‌‌​​‌‌⁠​​‌​‌‌‌​⁠​‌‌‌​​​​⁠​‌‌​‌​​​⁠with the number 7. From that information we can now create a wordlist using crunch and deliver the output directly to aircrack-ng without writing the file to the hard drive.


This can be done using pipes:
```
crunch 8 8 0123456789 -s 70000000 | aircrack-ng -w - -b AA:BB:CC:DD:00:11 /path/to/handshake.cap
```

The first command above (the one before the pipe) means that we'll create a wordlist using crunch with a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 8 characters (since we know that the password always use 8 digits) using only numbers 0 to 9. The "-s" also tells crunch to start the list from 70000000.

We can then use pipes to make the standard output (stdout) of the first command to be the standard input (stdin) of the second command. Thus, whatever output crunch generates will be used by aircrack-ng as the wordlist.

In the second command, the "-w -" tells aircrack-ng to use the wordlist from stdin (that's what the dash means). The "-b" is used to specify ​‌​​​​​‌⁠​‌‌‌​‌​‌⁠​‌‌‌​‌​​⁠​‌‌​‌​​​⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌‌⁠​‌‌‌​​‌​⁠​​‌‌‌​‌​⁠​​‌​​​​​⁠​‌​​​​​‌⁠​‌‌​​​‌‌⁠​‌‌‌​​‌​⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌‌⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌​⁠​‌‌​‌​​‌⁠​‌‌‌‌​​​⁠​​‌​​​​​⁠​‌‌​​​‌‌⁠​‌‌​‌‌‌‌⁠​‌‌​​‌​​⁠​‌‌​​‌​‌⁠​‌‌‌​​‌​⁠​‌‌‌​​‌‌⁠​​‌​‌‌‌​⁠​‌‌‌​​​​⁠​‌‌​‌​​​⁠the bssid of the targer router (AA:BB:CC:DD:00:11) and the last parameter (/path/to/handshake.cap) is the absolute path to the captured WPA2 handshake. You can also use a relative path depending on your current working directory.

Now the cracking process may take a while depending on your processor speed but I believe it is possible to crack that password pattern within a few seconds to a couple of hours.
